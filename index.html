        <strong> Scaling Measurements of Collaborative Capabilities.</strong> AI progress has traditionally been benchmarked through static tasks that abstract away the complexities of human–AI interaction. I develop algorithmic frameworks that reliably measure interaction with users at scale.

                <li> I co-created Copilot Arena, a platform that integrates preference collection directly into developers’ working environments.
                    Copilot Arena has served over 10 million suggestions from over 20 models and collected over 30k pairwise judgements, enabling insights that are only possible at this scale. 
                    Copilot Arena was used to evaluate pre-released versions of multiple coding models and was featured in the Wall Street Journal.
                </li>
                <li>To rigorously and efficiently evaluate agent designs, we introduce PULSE, which trains an ML model to predict user satisfaction and compues results by combining human satisfaction ratings with model-generated pseudo-labels using statistical inference techniques.
                    I collaborated with OpenHands to deploy the framework at scale and collect in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users and XXk trajectories.

        <strong> LLMs as Human Proxies for Design Space Exploration.</strong> To enable more systematic coverage of the design space beyond what is feasible with a sampled user population, a complementary direction is employing simulated users powered by ML models or LLMs to approximate human decisions.
